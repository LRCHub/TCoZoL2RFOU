Feel it, break your bones
Mr. Jones
Taste me, as I bleed
Taste my need

And spaceboy I've missed you
Spinning round my head
Anyway you choose me
You'll break instead

Watch me, death defy
Defile my life
I don't need, I don't care
Please

I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home

'Cause when a lover aches
That's when a lover breaks
I wanna go home
I wanna go home

And spaceboy they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And anyway you choose me
We won't belong

We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
