Every night you
light me with your gasoline
Everytime I feel delight
when you recall my name
So you can be my shining
star tonight
I'm not alone
with all your love
Fly across the sky
You will be mine
I can feel your
dream with you BABE
Gonna get you
like a space boy!
wowowowow
I'm ready Babe
Gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Dive into your heart baby
Gonna get you
like a space boy!
wowowowow
I need you babe
Gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Take a chance with me baby

Every night you
drive me crazy
like you know
Everyday I scream
so loud you'll
always be my queen
So you can be my shining
star tonight
I'm not alone
with all your love
Fly across the sky
You will be mine
I can feel your
dream with you BABE
Gonna get you
like a space boy!
